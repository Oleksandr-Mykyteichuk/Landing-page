Project: Responsive Landing Page Layout
This project demonstrates fundamental and rigorous skills in clean, semantic markup, which is the bedrock of Front-End development.

Functionality: Creation of a single-page promotional website focusing on visual presentation and a singular Call-to-Action (CTA).

Technologies: HTML5 for semantic structure and CSS3/Sass (or preprocessors) for efficient style organization.

Key Achievement: Ensuring full responsiveness of the layout, which displays correctly across all devices (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile) using Flexbox and/or Grid.

Skills Gained: Practical application of modern UI/UX principles in layout, including typography and cross-browser compatibility.
